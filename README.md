Interested in a privacy preserving way to connect with your network and gain back the value from what you've created?

This project is about revolutionizing the way the world connects.  Right now you're the product and each platform is trying to do too many things.  It's a confusing, predatory space where your participation has limited value (to you) and you face censorship if you speak your mind.  You're vulnerable to account breaches and your data is nothing more than a commodity sold to the highest bidder to gather market intelligence and then used mostly to advertise.

We believe in empowering and connecting individuals through a private by default, decentralized medium of exchange.  You've built up a body of work, you should benefit from your influence and reach. Your data, conversations, connections and preferences should belong to you not to private corporations or data warehouses.

Kind of like how the internet was supposed to work in the first place ;)

User data will be private by default and accounts will mesh with an existing ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work. Inquiries on ways you can contribute and partner with us are welcome, send these to: advancetechmedia@protonmail.com

We won't release anything until ready but when we do the source code will be open.
