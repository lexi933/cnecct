Hi everyone,

We're revolutionizing the way the world does social. Right now you're the product and each platform is trying to do too many things. It's a confusing, predatory space where your content has little value (to you) and you face censorship if you say the wrong thing or an share unpopular viewpoint.

We're building a way for you to gain back the value from your content. You will own this going forward and you will benefit from your work, influence and reach.

We believe in empowering and connecting individuals through a decentralized medium of exchange.

Kind of like how the internet was supposed to work in the first place ;)

**On Partnerships and the System**

We're developing our partnerships along with our system and while we're experimenting with a new protocol for the user side of the platform we need to be certain how this will scale and mesh with an existing ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work.

We won't release anything until ready but when we do our source code will be open.
